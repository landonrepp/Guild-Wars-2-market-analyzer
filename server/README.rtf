Guild-Wars 2 Market Analyzer is a project that sets out to bring market analysis tools to the 
in-game economy of Guild Wars 2 (GW2). It currently provides a resource to scrape and store data from the
official GW2 API into a mysql database, then display that data in a timeseries format. The project also 
features a list view of different items that have high margins between their buy and sell orders to help
users quickly identify good investments.
